# Chess
Our dev team at Unlease is creating a special version of the popular game ‘Chess’. 
Your task is to create the chessboard (16 x 16) and add one moveable piece to it.

## Task 1: Drag and Drop
- Create functionality that allows the user to drag and drop the piece to a 
different square on the chessboard 

## Task 2 (Optional): Turn the anonymous piece into a Knight

- Only allow your piece to move to a square two squares horizontally and 
one vertically, or two squares vertically and one square horizontally

- When a user tries to drag the piece, highlight all the possible squares that 
it can be dropped to 

## Task 3 (Optional): Persist the new position 

- Ensure that the new position of the piece can be persisted so it doesn’t get 
lost when the page is refreshed or opened in a different browser

---

## Technical considerations 

- You need to deliver a web application, i.e runs in a browser 

- You need to use ReactJS to solve this exercise (preferably with a Flux 
implementation)

- It should be easy to run locally or available online 

- Do not use React DnD library to handle drag and drop

## What you need to submit 

- Source code by email or Github

- Provide a publically available URL or clear instructions for running the 
code locally

- Reasonable test coverage

- Comments as deemed necessary

- Documentation (as necessary)

Good luck and Good Knight!
